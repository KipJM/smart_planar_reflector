This plugin is inspired by gd_planar_reflection by RisingThumb (https://github.com/RisingThumb/gd_planar_reflection)  
Since almost all code has been modified or deleted from the original repo, I do not consider it a fork of RisingThumb's project.  
However, their orignal plugin was incredibly useful in inspiring the development of this project.
